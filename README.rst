==================
The CGAT pipelines
==================

In CGAT_ we have developed a set of ruffus_ based pipelines in comparative genomics
and NGS analysis. The pipelines are generally available and should
be fairly portable. Some documentation of the pipelines is
`here <https://www.cgat.org/downloads/public/cgatpipelines/documentation>`_.

We are working on improving the existing documentation and portability of the code
to release a set of production pipelines soon so please stay tuned.

Meanwhile, in this repository you may find a set of working pipelines that
are under continuous development and changing rapidly. However, they might
give some ideas or building blocks when developing your own pipelines.

For questions, please open a new issue on
`GitHub
<https://github.com/CGATOxford/CGATPipelines/issues>`_.
