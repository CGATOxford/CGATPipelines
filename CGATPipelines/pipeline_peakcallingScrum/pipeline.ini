# Regarding parameter settings in SICER, window size is 200 by default
# (to represent single nucleosome resolution). And gap size is usually 1
# - 3 window size, i.e. 200, 400 or 600. For sharp peaks like H3K4me3,
# the gap size doesn t affect much on the results. For broad peaks as
# H3K27me3, H3K9me3 or H3K36me3, we recommend 600 for gap size.

# H3K4ME3: window_size=200, gap_size=200
