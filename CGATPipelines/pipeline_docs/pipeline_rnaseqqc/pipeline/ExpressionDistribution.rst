Expression distributions
========================

Summary
=======

Expression distributions should be similar for samples from similar
tissues etc. Stark differences between samples from similar RNA
samples should raise concern.

Typically you will see a bimodal distribution of expression values
with a spike at ~0 log2TPM representing non- expressed or very lowly
expressed transcripts, and an approroximately normal distribution with
mean > 0 log2 TPM for expressed genes

   Distibution of expression values per sample, coloured by factor levels

Aims
----

Comparing the distribution of expression levels between samples can
highlight anomalous samples that might need excluding from downstream analysis.  


Inputs
------

A table of expression values in transcripts per million (TPM) for each 
transcript and samples generated by Sailfish and stored as 
"transcript_quantification" in the pipeline database.


Outputs
-------

A density plot showing the distribution of transcript expression
values (log2TPM). Each line represents a different sample.


How the results are generated
-----------------------------

1. Sample_ID, transcript_ID and TPM are extracted from the 
   "transcript_quantification" table in the pipeline database and
   entered into a dataframe
2. TPM values are log transformed, log2(TPM_count + 0.1)
3. A density plot is produced using the geom_density function from
   ggplot2

What you should expect
----------------------

Typically you will see a bimodal distribution of expression values
with a spike at ~0 log2TPM representing non- expressed or very lowly
expressed transcripts, and an approroximately normal distribution with
mean > 0 log2 TPM for expressed genes
