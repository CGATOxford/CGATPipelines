# Parameters for GSEA analysis.


[id_gsea]
# id type of input gene list.
type=entrez
# which gene id type is used for the analysis
# can be ensemblg, entrez or symbol
# The analysis will be based on this ID type 
# for symbol, append the organism id of the species.
# e.g. symbol_Homo_sapiens, symbol_Mus_musculus
## organism id in entrez - 9606 = human, 10090 = mouse
# others here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/
# NOTE:id type of gene list and gene set should be same. This option is 
# only for translating gene list id to your required id type.
to_convert=entrez

[db]

name=/ifs/projects/katherineb/pipeline_enrichment_testing/OO2/humannew
# common name of species - human, mouse, rat etc.
species=human

[id]
# which gene id type is used for the input gene lists
# can be ensemblg, entrez or symbol
# the analysis will be based on this ID type and the all genes background will be
# all IDs of this type in this organism
# NOTE - if this is ensemblg, all ensemblg IDs will be used as a background, including multiple
# identifiers for the same gene
# for symbol, append the scientific name of the species the gene ids are from
# e.g. symbol_Homo_sapiens, symbol_Mus_musculus
type=symbol_Homo_sapiens


[stats]
# details of statistical tests for enrichment

# how to identifiy enriched terms - currently implemented are termbyterm - look for
# enrichment of each term irrespective of other terms and elim - prioritise
# more derived parts of the ontology using the elim method described in 
# http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/13/1600.full.pdf
runtype=elim

# which statistical test to use to look for enrichment of each term
# currently only Fisher has been implemented
testtype=Fisher

# correction for multiple testing to apply - currently only bon (bonferroni)
# has been implemented
correction=bon

# minimum significant accepted pvalue
thresh=0.05

# if 1 write the lists of genes in the foreground and background which are
# annotated to the most enriched terms in each database to tsv files
# in the results.dir directory
writegenes=1
# the number of enriched terms for which to write gene lists for each database
# using a high number here may result in a very large number of files
# as file count will be number of foregrounds * number of backgrounds * ngenes
ngenes=5

[annotation_flatfiles]
# strings specifying the options for parsing any additional files containing annotations
# options are described in the pipeline module file
# any number of flatfiles can be specified in this section as 1=, 2=, 3= etc.
