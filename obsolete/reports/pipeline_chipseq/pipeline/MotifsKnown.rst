==================
Presence of motifs
==================

MAST is used to look for the presence of canonical motifs in the dataset.
Canonical motifs are known beforehand.

Summary
=======

The following plots show the percent of peaks that are explained by
the presence of a motif. The percentage of peaks explained is
estimated using MAST-curves (:pmid:`19160518`).

.. report:: Motifs.MastSummary
   :render: interleaved-bar-plot
   :transform: filter
   :tf-fields: MC-explained / %
   :layout: column-3
   :width: 200

   Percentage of peaks explained by motifs.

Location of motifs within intervals
===================================

Motifs should be located centrally within predicted binding intervals.

The following plots show distance of motifs within intervals from the
middle of an interval.

A strong motif displays a sigmoidal curve, while a weak/unspecific
motif creates a diagonal.

.. report:: Motifs.MastMotifLocationMiddle
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :as-lines:
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,cumulative
   :layout: column-3
   :width: 200

   Location of motifs within intervals. If several
   motifs are within an interval, the midpoint
   of all motifs is used. The x-axis shows the
   distance of the motif to the middle of the
   interval.

Control intervals
+++++++++++++++++

The following plots show the relative location of motifs within
*control* intervals, random genomic locations of the same size. 
These plots should all show a straight line.

.. report:: Motifs.MastControlLocationMiddle
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :as-lines:
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,cumulative
   :layout: column-3
   :width: 200

   Location of motifs within *control* intervals.
   If several motifs are within an interval, the midpoint
   of all motifs is used. The x-axis shows the
   distance of the motif to the peak.

Motifs and peak strength
========================

The following plot shows the proportion of peaks of a certain height
that contain a motif. For each combination of track and motif there
are two lines:
   * proportion with motif: proportion of peaks of height equal or
     greater than X that contain a motif. This usually starts at 100%
     for high peaks (high values of X) but then drops off to the
     number of peaks that contain a motif.

   * recall: proportion of peaks of height equal or greater than
     X. This is a reverse cumulative distribution starting at low
     values for high X and then increasing to 100% as X decreases.

.. report:: Motifs.MastPeakValWithMotif
   :render: line-plot
   :groupby: track
   :as-lines:
   :layout: column-3
   :width: 200

   Proportion of intervals with a certain peakvalue or higher
   that contain a motif.

Motifs and interval locations
=============================

.. report:: Motifs.AnnotationsMotifs
   :render: matrix-plot
   :layout: column-4
   :width: 300

   This plot shows the number of intervals with or without motif
   and their location.

.. report:: Motifs.AnnotationsPeakVal
   :render: matrix-plot
   :layout: column-4
   :width: 300

   This plot shows the number of intervals at a certain location
   together with the binding strength (:term:`peakval`)

Number of motifs per interval
=============================

The following table shows stats on the number of motifs per interval.

.. report:: Motifs.MastNumberOfMotifs
   :render: table
   :transform: stats

   Number of motifs per interval

The following table shows histograms with the number of motifs per interval
for each motif and dataset.

.. report:: Motifs.MastNumberOfMotifs
   :render: table
   :transform: histogram
   :tf-bins: arange(0,20,1)

   Number of motifs per interval


Distance from peak
++++++++++++++++++

The following plots show distance of motifs within intervals from the
interval peak, the position with the largest number of reads.

A strong motif displays a sigmoidal curve, while a weak/unspecific
motif creates a diagonal.

.. report:: Motifs.MastMotifLocation
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :as-lines:
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,cumulative
   :layout: column-3
   :width: 200

   Location of motifs within intervals. If several
   motifs are within an interval, the midpoint
   of all motifs is used. The x-axis shows the
   distance of the motif to the peak.
