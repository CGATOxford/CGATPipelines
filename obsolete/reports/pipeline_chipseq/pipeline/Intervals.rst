Number of intervals in each set
=================================

The following table presents the number of intervals and 
the average interval width per set:

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalsSummary
   :render: table

   Number of intervals and lengths of intervals in
   all runs

The following figure shows the number of intervals and
average interval width per set:

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalsSummary
   :render: interleaved-bar-plot
   :transform: filter
   :tf-fields: nintervals,<length>

   Number of intervals and lengths of intervals in
   all runs

Distribution of peak scores
===========================

Average values
--------------

The following plot shows the distribution of the
average read coverage within intervals.

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalAverageValues
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :tf-range: 0,50
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,reverse-cumulative
   :as-lines:

   Distribution of the average read depth within intervals.

Values at peak
--------------

The following plot shows the distribution of the maximum (peak) 
read coverage within intervals.

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalPeakValues
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :tf-range: 0,100
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,reverse-cumulative
   :as-lines:

   Distribution of the maximum read depth within intervals.

Distribution of interval size
=============================

The following plot shows the distribution of interval size for each set.

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalLengths
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :logscale: x
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total
   :as-lines:

   Distribution of interval lengths

Peak location
=============

The following plot shows the distribution of the peak location within
an interval for each set, i.e. is it on the sides or the middle
of an interval. Note that this counting does not take into account
strandedness.

.. report:: Intervals.PeakLocation
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total
   :as-lines:
  
   Distance of peak towards start/end of interval normalized
   by the size of the interval.

The following plot shows the distribution of the peak distance within
an interval for each set, i.e. is it on the sides or the middle
of an interval. Note that this counting does not take into account
strandedness.

.. report:: Intervals.PeakDistance
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :logscale: x
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total
   :as-lines:
  
   Distance of peak towards start/end of interval

Correlation of interval size and peak score
===========================================

The following table tests if there is a correlation 
between interval size and average value within each set.

.. report:: Intervals.IntervalLengthVsAverageValue
   :render: table
   :transform: correlation
 
   Scatter plots showing the correlation between 
   length and average value

The following table tests if there is a correlation 
between interval size and the peak value within each set.
