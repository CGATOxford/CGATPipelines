========================
MACS Intervals by Length
========================

This section list intervals of >3kb in length that overlap an Ensembl protein coding gene. The table is sorted by interval length. 
The columns 'pover1' and 'pover2' indicate the percentage of the CAPseq interval that overlaps the gene and the percentage of the gene overlapped by the CAPseq interval respectively.
