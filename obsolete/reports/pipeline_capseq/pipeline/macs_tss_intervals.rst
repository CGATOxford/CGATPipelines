===================
MACS TSS Intervals
===================

The following table presents the number of intervals that are within 1kb of a transcriptional start site:

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalSummary
   :render: table

   Intervals within 1kb of a TSS

Length
------

The following plot shows the distribution of interval length for each set.

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalLengths
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :logscale: x
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total
   :as-lines:
   :xtitle: Interval Length
   :layout: column-2

   Distribution of interval lengths

Average Coverage
----------------

The following plot shows the distribution of average interval coverage for each set.
The average coverage is the average number of reads covering the bins that constitute the interval.

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalAverageValues
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :tf-range: 0,100
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,reverse-cumulative
   :as-lines:
   :xtitle: Average coverage
   :layout: column-2

   Distribution of the average number of reads
   matching to bins within an interval.

Maximum Coverage
----------------

The following plot shows the maximum interval coverage for each set.
The maximum coverage is the maximum number of reads falling into the
bins that constitute an interval. The interval peak is the position with the maximum
number of reads.

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalPeakValues
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :tf-range: 0,200
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,reverse-cumulative
   :as-lines:
   :xtitle: Maximum coverage
   :layout: column-2

   Distribution of the number of reads at the peak within an interval.
   The distribution list the proportion of intervals of a certain peak
   value or more.

Fold Change
-----------

The following plot shows the fold change over control (input) for each set.

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalFoldChange
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :tf-range: 0,100
   :tf-aggregate: normalized-total,reverse-cumulative
   :as-lines:
   :xtitle: Fold Change
   :layout: column-2

   Distribution of fold enrichment for interval compared to control.


CpG Density
-----------

The following plot shows the distribution of CpG density for each set.

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalCpGDensity
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :as-lines:
   :layout: column-2
   :xtitle: CpG Density

   Distribution of CpG density


CpG Observed/Expected
----------------------

The following plots show the distribution of observed/expected CpGs for each set.
The expected number of CpG dinucleotides was calculated as the product of the number of C and G nucleotides 
in the interval divided by the interval length as in Emboss cpgplot.
The control dataset was generated by taking an interval of the same size 10kb upstream of the CpG island.

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalCpGObsExp2
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :as-lines:
   :layout: column-2
   :xtitle: CpG Observed/Expected

   Distribution observed/expected CpGs (expected = nC*nG/length)


GC Content
------------

The following plot shows the distribution of GC content for each set.

.. report:: macs_tss_intervals.tssIntervalGCContent
   :render: line-plot
   :transform: histogram
   :groupby: all
   :as-lines:
   :layout: column-2
   :xtitle: GC Content

   Distribution of GC content
