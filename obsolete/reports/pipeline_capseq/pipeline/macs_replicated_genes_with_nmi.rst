Ensembl Protein-coding Genes with TSS-associated CAPseq Intervals
==================================================================

Ensembl protein-coding genes were annoataed as having a CAPseq interval within 1kb of their TSS. 
Two different TSS sets were used: one TSS per transcript and one TSS per gene (most 5').
