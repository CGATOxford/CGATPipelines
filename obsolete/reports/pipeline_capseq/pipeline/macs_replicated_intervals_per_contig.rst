MACS Replicated Intervals Per Contig
=====================================

Replicated intervals were generated by first merging the intervals from all biological replicates for each tissue 
and then removing merged intervals that did not overlap with at least one original interval in each replicate. 
The following table presents the number of intervals found in all replicates of each tissue:
